          <p>"Banglar mati, Banglar jol"....West Bengal is one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse states of India. The people of West Bengal inherit their identity and aspiration from the larger Indian mosaic.
            One can still recapture the colonial era in its relics which survived the state's progressive development.</p>
          <p>The land of West Bengal has in it intricately woven stories of many bright mornings and dark nights; stories of many civilisations have left their footprints here. Awash in the memory of that rich history and heritage West Bengal boasts of
            different ethnicities, cultures, religions, people and languages which add to this beautiful landscape. And that is why Deshbandhu Chittaranjan once said - "There is an eternal truth in the soil of Bengal...
            It is that eternal truth that has been expressed through innumerable changes, evolution and revolutions in Bengal. It is that truth which has
            proclaimed itself in literature, philosophy, poetry, war, revolution, religion and karma, in ignorance, in unrighteousness, in freedom and in subjection. That is Bengal's life - Bengal's soil and Bengal's water are the external forms of that life."</p>
          <p>West Bengal aims to become a preferred tourism and tourism-related investment destination by leveraging its unique geographical setting along with its various tourism-related assets.
            It will develop necessary infrastructure and promote tourism in an integrated manner which will not only bring in more investment and further the socio-economic goals of the Government,
            but also ensure that all these are in conformity with the relevant acts, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection.
          </p>
          <p>The overall aim is to see that the tourism sector contributes towards improving the quality of life of people in general.</p>

          <p>Indian statesman Gopalkrishna Gokhale once said "what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow!" Renowned worldwide as a thriving, dynamic centre for art & literature,
            West Bengal's location, fascinating culture, people history and heritage have made this statement true in more ways than one.</p>
          <p>West Bengal aims to become a preferred tourism and tourism-related investment destination by leveraging its unique geographical setting along with its various tourism-related assets.
            It will develop necessary infrastructure and promote tourism in an integrated manner which will not only bring in more investment and further the socio-economic goals of the Government,

          <p>
            West Bengal is a State rich in resources which can be leveraged for tourism. As per the State Tourism Policy, the State will focus on these assets to proactively develop different tourism products/destinations.
